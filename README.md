        - **Perceptron Algorithm:** The perceptron algorithm is an algorithm for classifying data. It is the building block of neural networks.
        - **Decision Trees:** Decision trees are a structure for decision-making where each decision leads to a set of consequences or additional decisions.
        - **Naive Bayes:** Naive Bayesian Algorithms are powerful tools for creating classifiers for incoming labeled data. Specifically Naive Bayes is frequently used with text data and classification problems.
        - **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Support vector machines are a common method used for classification problems. They have been proven effective using what is known as the 'kernel' trick!
        - **Ensemble Methods:** Bagging and boosting are two common ensemble methods for combining simple algorithms to make more advanced models that work better than the simple algorithms would on their own.
        - **Model Evaluation Metrics:** Learn the main metrics to evaluate models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and more!
        - **Training and Tuning:** Learn the main types of errors that can occur during training, and several methods to deal with them and optimize your machine learning models.
